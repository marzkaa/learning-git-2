            <h1>Queen - Bohemian Rhapsody</h1>
            <p>Is this the real life?<br> 
                Is this just fantasy?<br>
                Caught in a landslide, no escape from reality.<br> 
                Open your eyes, look up to the skies and see. <br>
                I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy,<br> 
                Because I'm easy come, easy go, little high, little low.<br>
                Anyway the wind blows <br>
                Doesn't really matter to me, to me. <br>
